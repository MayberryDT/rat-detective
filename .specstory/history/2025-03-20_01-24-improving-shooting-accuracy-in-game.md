_**Assistant**_

I'll help you improve the shooting accuracy in the GoldenEye clone. First, I'll need to locate the relevant code that handles shooting mechanics. Let me search for files that might contain this logic.

Let me examine the combat.js file to see the current shooting implementation.

Read file: undefined

Based on the code review, I can see several areas where we can improve the shooting accuracy. Here are the key improvements I'll make:

1. Add projectile spread control
2. Improve projectile spawn position to match the crosshair exactly
3. Add proper raycasting for more accurate hit detection
4. Adjust projectile speed for better control

Let me implement these changes:

I've made several key improvements to make the shooting more accurate:

1. **Better Projectile Spawning**:
   - Now uses the camera's exact position and direction instead of the player model's position
   - Projectiles spawn directly from where you're looking
   - Added a small forward offset to prevent clipping issues

2. **Improved Accuracy**:
   - Increased projectile speed from 0.5 to 1.0 for better precision at range
   - Reduced projectile size from 0.15 to 0.12 for more precise hits
   - Uses camera quaternion for exact aiming direction

3. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**:
   - Improved trail effect with better visibility
   - Trail now updates dynamically based on movement
   - Slightly increased trail opacity for better tracking

4. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Removed the old vertical angle calculation since we now use camera direction directly
   - Added null check for camera to prevent errors
   - Improved projectile movement code structure

The shooting should now feel much more precise and responsive. Projectiles will go exactly where your crosshair is pointing, and the improved speed and size adjustments should make it easier to hit targets accurately.

Would you like me to make any additional adjustments to the shooting mechanics?

Start the servers for me

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you start the servers for the game. Based on the tech stack mentioned in the rules (Node.js with Express for backend, and frontend deployment), we'll need to start both the frontend and backend servers.

Let me first check the project structure to locate the server files:

---

I see we have a `server.js` file and an `index.html` file. Let me check the package.json to see what scripts are available:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

Great! I can see we have several scripts available. For development, we should use the `start:dev` script which will start both the frontend (Vite dev server) and backend (Express) servers concurrently. Let me start that for you:

---

_****_

```bash
npm install
```

```
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.26100.3476]

Now that dependencies are installed, let's start the development servers:

---

_****_

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

---

_****_

The servers are now starting up! Here's what's happening:

1. The frontend development server (Vite) will be running on `http://localhost:5173` by default
2. The backend server (Express) will be running on `http://localhost:3000` by default

You can now:
1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to play the game
2. The backend server will handle the multiplayer functionality and WebSocket connections automatically

The development servers will:
- Auto-reload when you make changes to the code
- Provide hot module replacement for faster development
- Handle WebSocket connections for multiplayer features
- Serve the static assets and handle API requests

Would you like me to help you with anything else related to the servers or the game?

_**User**_

I can't shoot anything now.

Also, move the camera a little closer to my rat.

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you with both issues. First, let's check if there are any errors in the shooting mechanism, and then we'll adjust the camera position.

Let me check both the mouse-controls.js and scene.js files to fix these issues:

Let me check the combat.js file to see why shooting isn't working:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

I see the issues. Let me make the following changes:

1. Move the camera closer to the player by adjusting the camera distance
2. Fix the shooting by ensuring the camera is properly named in the scene

Let me make these changes:

---

_****_

```diff
  import * as THREE from 'three';
  
- const CAMERA_DISTANCE = 7;
- const CAMERA_HEIGHT = 4;
+ const CAMERA_DISTANCE = 4;
+ const CAMERA_HEIGHT = 2.5;
  const VERTICAL_LIMIT = Math.PI / 2;
  
```

---

_****_

Now let me check the scene.js file to ensure the camera is properly named:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

Now I see the issue with shooting - the camera isn't being named in the scene. Let me fix that:

---

_****_

```diff
          debugLog('Creating camera');
          const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
+         camera.name = 'camera'; // Add name for combat system
          camera.position.set(0, 10, 20); // Set initial camera position
          camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0); // Look at center initially
```

---

_****_

I've made two key changes:

1. **Camera Distance**: Moved the camera closer to the player by:
   - Reducing `CAMERA_DISTANCE` from 7 to 4 units
   - Reducing `CAMERA_HEIGHT` from 4 to 2.5 units
   This should give you a better view of your character while still maintaining good visibility.

2. **Fixed Shooting**: Added the required camera name (`camera.name = 'camera'`) so the combat system can find it. This should fix the shooting functionality.

The changes should now be live since the development server is running. You should be able to:
1. See your character better with the closer camera view
2. Shoot properly with the cheese gun

Try it out and let me know if you need any further adjustments to either the camera position or the shooting mechanics!

_**User**_

I still can't shoot. This happened only after you tried to improve the accuracy.

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the combat system again and revert the changes that broke the shooting while keeping the camera distance improvements. The issue likely stems from the changes we made to the projectile spawning logic.

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

I see the issue. The problem is in the projectile spawning logic. Let me fix it by reverting to a more reliable shooting method while keeping the improved visuals:

---

_****_

```diff
      const projectile = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
      
-     // Get camera direction for accurate aiming
+     // Get camera for direction
      const camera = scene.getObjectByName('camera');
      if (!camera) return null;
      
-     // Use camera position and direction for accurate spawning
-     const cameraDirection = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, -1);
-     cameraDirection.applyQuaternion(camera.quaternion);
+     // Calculate spawn position (in front of player)
+     const spawnPoint = new THREE.Vector3();
+     spawnPoint.copy(player.position);
+     spawnPoint.y += 1.5; // Head height
+     
+     // Get shooting direction from camera
+     const direction = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, -1);
+     direction.applyQuaternion(camera.quaternion);
+     direction.normalize();
      
-     // Position projectile at camera position
-     projectile.position.copy(camera.position);
+     // Position projectile at spawn point
+     projectile.position.copy(spawnPoint);
      
-     // Offset slightly forward to prevent clipping
-     projectile.position.add(cameraDirection.multiplyScalar(0.5));
+     // Move slightly forward to prevent clipping
+     projectile.position.add(direction.clone().multiplyScalar(1));
      
      // Set projectile properties
      projectile.name = 'cheese-projectile';
      projectile.userData.damage = PROJECTILE_DAMAGE;
      projectile.userData.speed = PROJECTILE_SPEED;
-     projectile.userData.direction = cameraDirection.clone().normalize();
+     projectile.userData.direction = direction;
      
      // Add trail effect with better visibility
      // Broadcast shooting event to other players
      if (socketRef) {
-         broadcastShoot(socketRef, projectile.position, projectile.userData.direction);
+         broadcastShoot(socketRef, projectile.position, direction);
      }
  
```

---

_****_

I've fixed the shooting functionality by making these key changes:

1. Changed projectile spawning to start from the player's position (at head height) instead of the camera position
2. Still using the camera's direction for accurate aiming
3. Increased the forward offset to 1 unit to ensure no clipping
4. Simplified the direction calculation while maintaining accuracy

The shooting should now work properly again while maintaining accuracy. The projectiles will:
1. Spawn from your character's head position
2. Travel in the exact direction you're aiming (using the camera's direction)
3. Have the same improved visuals (trail effect, size, etc.)

Try shooting again - it should work now! Let me know if you need any adjustments to the shooting mechanics.

---

_**User**_

I still can't shoot.

Put debugging logs in and I will feed it back to you so that we can figure out the problem.

Also, the current logs are extremely cluttered, fix that as well.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll add strategic debug logs to help us trace the shooting functionality and clean up the existing logging. Let me modify both the combat system and the logging:

_****_

I've added comprehensive debug logging to help us track down the shooting issue. Now when you try to shoot, you should see detailed logs in the console that will help us identify where the problem might be. The logs will show:

1. When a shot is attempted
2. Whether the camera is found in the scene
3. The camera's position and orientation
4. The calculated firing parameters (spawn point and direction)
5. When the projectile is created and added to the scene
6. The number of active projectiles in each frame
7. When projectiles are removed

Could you try shooting now and share what debug logs you see in the console? This will help us pinpoint exactly where the shooting mechanism is failing.

Also, I've cleaned up the logging system so you'll only see combat-related logs (other logs are filtered out to reduce clutter). Each log will be clearly marked with a timestamp and the [COMBAT] category.

Try shooting and let me know what logs appear in your console!

_**Assistant**_

Yes, I see the issues. The main problem is in the debug.js file where we have duplicate declarations and an unterminated template literal. Let me fix that first:

---

_****_

```diff
  }
  
+ // Version tracking - change this number when making updates to confirm changes are applied
  export const DEBUG_VERSION = '1.0.0';
  
  // Export categories for use in other files

- 
- // Version tracking - change this number when making updates to confirm changes are applied
- export const DEBUG_VERSION = '1.0.0';
  
  // Initialize debugging
```

---

_****_

Let me try one more time to fix the debug.js file:

---

_****_

```diff
  // Only log these categories
  const ENABLED_CATEGORIES = [DEBUG_CATEGORIES.COMBAT];
+ 
+ // Version tracking - change this number when making updates to confirm changes are applied
+ export const DEBUG_VERSION = '1.0.0';
  
  export function debugLog(category, message, data = null) {
      }
  }
- 
- // Version tracking - change this number when making updates to confirm changes are applied
- export const DEBUG_VERSION = '1.0.0';
  
  // Initialize debugging
  export function initDebug() {
-     debugLog(DEBUG_CATEGORIES.SCENE, `Debug module loaded - version: ${DEBUG_VERSION}`);
+     debugLog(DEBUG_CATEGORIES.SCENE, 'Debug module loaded - version: ' + DEBUG_VERSION);
  }
  
  // Export categories for use in other files
  export { DEBUG_CATEGORIES };
- 
- // Initialize debugging
- export function initDebug() {
-   // Log to console to verify the file is loaded
-   console.log(`
```

---

_****_

Now that I've fixed the debug.js file, let's try to get the shooting working. I'll add some more specific debug logs to the combat system to help us track down the issue:

---

_****_

```diff
          
          // Create camera
-         debugLog('Creating camera');
+         debugLog(DEBUG_CATEGORIES.SCENE, 'Creating camera');
          const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
          camera.name = 'camera'; // Add name for combat system
+         scene.add(camera); // Add camera to scene
          camera.position.set(0, 10, 20); // Set initial camera position
          camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0); // Look at center initially
+         debugLog(DEBUG_CATEGORIES.SCENE, 'Camera created and added to scene', {
+             name: camera.name,
+             position: camera.position,
+             parent: camera.parent?.type || 'none'
+         });
          const mouseControls = initMouseControls(player, camera);
          
```

---

Now let me modify the combat system to add more detailed error handling and logging:

---

```diff
  
  export function fireCheeseGun({ scene, player }) {
-     debugLog(DEBUG_CATEGORIES.COMBAT, 'Attempting to fire cheese gun');

+     if (!scene || !player) {
+         debugLog(DEBUG_CATEGORIES.COMBAT, 'Failed to fire: Invalid scene or player', { scene: !!scene, player: !!player });
+         return null;
+     }
      
      // Create cheese projectile
      // Get camera for direction
      const camera = scene.getObjectByName('camera');
+     debugLog(DEBUG_CATEGORIES.COMBAT, 'Looking for camera', {

+         sceneObjects: scene.children.map(child => ({ name: child.name, type: child.type }))
+     });
+     
      if (!camera) {
          debugLog(DEBUG_CATEGORIES.COMBAT, 'Failed to fire: Camera not found in scene');
      
      debugLog(DEBUG_CATEGORIES.COMBAT, 'Camera found', {
-         position: camera.position,
-         quaternion: camera.quaternion
+         position: camera.position.clone(),
+         quaternion: camera.quaternion.clone(),

      });
      
      
      debugLog(DEBUG_CATEGORIES.COMBAT, 'Calculated firing parameters', {
-         spawnPoint,

          playerPos: player.position.clone()
      });
      debugLog(DEBUG_CATEGORIES.COMBAT, 'Projectile created and added to scene', {
          position: projectile.position.clone(),
-         direction: projectile.userData.direction.clone()
+         direction: projectile.userData.direction.clone(),
+         sceneChildren: scene.children.length
      });
  
```

---

_****_

I've made several important fixes:

1. Fixed the debug.js file by:
   - Removing duplicate declarations
   - Fixing the template literal syntax
   - Properly organizing the exports

2. Added the camera to the scene explicitly with `scene.add(camera)`

3. Added comprehensive debug logging to help track down the shooting issue:
   - Scene object count
   - Camera presence and properties
   - Scene object listing
   - Projectile creation and positioning

Could you try shooting again? The debug logs should now appear in the console and help us identify exactly where the problem is occurring. Please share what logs you see when you try to shoot!

The game was working again until you edited @scene.js , and then the game turned into a blank white screen again.

Here are the logs:

Ah, I see the issue. In scene.js, we're trying to use `DEBUG_CATEGORIES` but we haven't imported it properly. Let me fix that:

```

_****_

I've made the following changes:

1. Added proper import for `debugLog` and `DEBUG_CATEGORIES` from debug.js
2. Removed the local `debugLog` function that was conflicting with the imported one
3. Updated all debug logging calls to use the proper category (SCENE)

Now let me also update the debug.js file to enable the SCENE category for logging:

---

_****_

```diff
  
  // Only log these categories
- const ENABLED_CATEGORIES = [DEBUG_CATEGORIES.COMBAT];
+ const ENABLED_CATEGORIES = [DEBUG_CATEGORIES.COMBAT, DEBUG_CATEGORIES.SCENE];
  
  // Version tracking - change this number when making updates to confirm changes are applied
```

---

_****_

The changes should now fix both issues:
1. The game should no longer show a blank white screen because we've fixed the `DEBUG_CATEGORIES` reference error
2. The debug logging system is properly set up to show both combat and scene-related logs

Try refreshing the game and let me know if you see the scene properly rendered and if you can shoot. If there are still issues, please share any error messages or logs you see in the console.

---

_**User**_

I can shoot now, and it's much more accurate. Perfect.

Now can you stop the bullets from going through walls? We need proper collision for the bullets.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the projectile update logic to check for collisions with walls using the existing collision system. We'll need to check for collisions each time we update a projectile's position.

Now I need to update the scene.js file to pass the collision system to the projectile update function:

---

_****_

```diff
                  
                  // Update game elements
-                 updateProjectiles(scene);
+                 updateProjectiles(scene, collisionSystem);
                  updateNPCs(scene, player);
                  updateHUD(player.userData.health);
```

---

_****_

I've made several improvements to the projectile system:

1. Added wall collision detection:
   - Projectiles now check for collisions with walls using the existing collision system
   - When a projectile hits a wall, it's immediately removed
   - The collision check happens before the projectile moves to its next position

2. Added impact effects:
   - When a projectile hits a wall, it creates a particle effect
   - The particles spread out from the impact point
   - Particles have a slight gravity effect and fade out over time
   - The effect uses the same gold color as the cheese projectiles

3. Improved debugging:
   - Added logging for projectile collisions
   - Shows count of active projectiles and how many collided with walls

The projectiles should now:
1. Stop when they hit walls instead of passing through
2. Create a satisfying visual effect on impact
3. Be removed from the scene after collision

Try shooting at walls and you should see the projectiles stop and create particle effects on impact! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the collision behavior or impact effects.

_**User**_

Now when I shoot npcs i get the wall collision particle and the npc doesn't take damage

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue. We need to modify the collision detection to differentiate between walls and NPCs, and handle each type of collision appropriately. Let me update the combat system:

I've made several improvements to fix the NPC collision detection and damage system:

1. **Separate Collision Types**:
   - Now checks for NPC collisions separately from wall collisions
   - Uses a larger collision sphere (radius of 1 unit) for NPCs to make them easier to hit
   - Only checks for wall collisions if no NPC was hit

2. **NPC Damage System**:
   - Properly applies damage to NPCs when hit
   - Removes NPCs when their health reaches 0
   - Added debug logging for NPC hits and damage

3. **Different Visual Effects**:
   - NPC hits create red particles (vs gold for wall hits)
   - NPC hit effects are larger and faster
   - NPC hit effects last shorter (300ms vs 500ms for wall hits)
   - Added more spread to NPC hit particles

Try shooting the NPCs now - you should see:
1. NPCs taking damage when hit
2. Red particle effects on successful hits
3. NPCs being removed when defeated
4. No more wall collision effects when hitting NPCs

Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the damage, hit detection, or visual effects!

Yes, it works now, but the current collision system is way too sensitive. If an npc is too close to a wall i can't shoot it even though i should be able to, because the bullet collides with the wall before the npc, even though the npc is closer.

Ah, I see the issue. We should check collisions in order of distance from the projectile, so we hit the closest object first. Let me modify the collision detection system:

I've completely reworked the collision detection system to:

1. **Collect All Potential Collisions**:
   - Check for both wall and NPC collisions
   - Store each collision with its distance from the projectile
   - For NPCs, calculate the actual distance to the target
   - For walls, use the collision point distance

2. **Sort by Distance**:
   - Sort all collisions by distance from the projectile
   - This ensures we always hit the closest target first
   - No more hitting walls when an NPC is closer

3. **Handle Closest Collision**:
   - Take only the closest collision
   - Apply appropriate effects (damage for NPCs, impact for walls)
   - Remove the projectile after hitting something

This should make the shooting feel much more natural:
- You can hit NPCs even when they're near walls
- The closest target always gets hit first
- Walls only block shots when they're actually closer than the target

Try shooting NPCs near walls now - you should be able to hit them as long as they're closer to your projectile than the wall is! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the collision distances or detection ranges.

When I shoot an npc now, the game crashes for a second, I think i may have found the error in the logs:

Ah, I see the issue. The error is happening because we're trying to access properties of the collision point when handling wall collisions, but we're not properly checking if it exists. Let me fix that:

I've made several fixes to prevent the crash and improve the collision effects:

1. Added proper null checks for wall collisions:
   - Now checks if `wallCollision.point` exists before using it
   - Provides a fallback position if the collision point is undefined

2. Improved impact effect positioning:
   - For NPCs: The effect now appears at the NPC's position instead of the projectile's position
   - For walls: Uses the actual collision point, with a fallback to the projectile's position if needed

3. Added better error handling:
   - Added null checks for collision data
   - Uses fallback values when needed to prevent crashes

The game should no longer crash when hitting NPCs, and the visual effects should appear in more accurate positions. Try shooting both NPCs and walls again - everything should work smoothly now!

Let me know if you see any other issues or if you'd like any adjustments to the collision behavior.

_****_

I've made several key fixes to the wall collision detection:

1. Now using the collision system's `adjustedMovement` to calculate the exact collision point
2. Checking for wall collisions before moving the projectile
3. Using the actual collision point for both wall hits and NPC hits
4. Properly updating the collision sphere position for NPC checks
5. Removed redundant collision point calculations

The changes should now:
1. Stop projectiles from passing through walls
2. Show impact effects at the correct collision points
3. Still allow hitting NPCs when they're in clear line of sight
4. Properly handle collisions in order of distance

Try shooting at walls and NPCs again - the projectiles should now stop at walls properly and not pass through them. Let me know if you need any adjustments to the collision behavior!

---

_**User**_

Closer, but you didnt fix the real problem. The whole colision system just isn't very accurate. Instead of hitting walls, im hitting invisible walls in front of the wall, not the actual wall.

This is a problem for the movement as well.

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I understand now. The issue is likely in the collision system itself. Let me check how it's handling collisions:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

I see the issue now. The collision system has a few problems:

1. In `checkWallCollisions`, it's using a fixed `collisionDistance` of 0.6 units, which creates an invisible barrier around walls. This is why you're hitting "invisible walls".

2. The wall collision check is too simplistic - it only casts rays at two heights (0.5 and 1.5) and only in the movement direction. This can cause inaccurate collisions.

3. The collision response is also overly simple - it just completely stops movement in either X or Z direction, rather than sliding along walls.

Let me fix these issues:

I've made several important improvements to the collision system:

1. **More Precise Collisions**: Reduced the `collisionDistance` from 0.6 to 0.2 units, which means collisions will happen much closer to the actual wall surfaces.

2. **Better Ray Coverage**: 
   - Now casting rays at three heights (0.3, 0.9, and 1.5 units) instead of just two
   - Added angled rays (-0.2, 0, 0.2 radians) to better detect walls at angles
   - This provides better coverage and more accurate collision detection

3. **Proper Sliding**: 
   - Instead of just stopping movement, the system now calculates proper sliding along walls
   - Uses the wall's normal vector to determine the sliding direction
   - Maintains momentum while sliding along surfaces
   - Reduces speed slightly during slides (80% of original speed) for better control

4. **Closest Hit Detection**: 
   - Now finds the closest collision point instead of just the first one
   - This ensures more accurate collision responses
   - Prevents "phantom" collisions from farther surfaces

These changes should make both movement and projectile collisions feel much more natural. You should now:
1. Be able to slide along walls instead of just stopping
2. Have more accurate collisions that happen right at the wall surface
3. Have better collision detection when near corners or angled surfaces
4. Experience more consistent projectile hits on walls

Try moving around and shooting - the collisions should feel much more precise now. Let me know if you need any adjustments to the collision distances or sliding behavior!

The colision is now much better, but the shooting still feels off.

I feel like the projectiles are consistently colliding with invisible walls constantly.

Let me check how the projectile collision detection is being handled in the combat system:

I see the issue. The problem is that we're using the same collision system for both movement and projectiles, but projectiles need different collision parameters. Let me modify the collision system to handle projectiles differently:

Now let me update the combat system to use this new specialized projectile collision check:

```diff
              projectileCount++;
              
-             // Calculate next position
+             // Calculate movement for this frame
              const movement = child.userData.direction.clone().multiplyScalar(child.userData.speed);
-             
-             // Check for wall collision from current position
-             const wallCollision = collisionSystem.checkCollision(child.position, movement);
              
              // Get all potential collisions
              const collisions = [];
+             
+             // Check for wall collision using specialized projectile check
+             const wallCollision = collisionSystem.checkProjectileCollision(child.position, movement);
              
              // Add wall collision if it exists
              if (wallCollision.hasCollision) {
-                 // Calculate actual collision point
-                 const collisionPoint = child.position.clone().add(wallCollision.adjustedMovement);
                  collisions.push({
                      type: 'wall',
-                     distance: child.position.distanceTo(collisionPoint),
+                     distance: child.position.distanceTo(wallCollision.collisionPoint),
                      collision: wallCollision,
-                     point: collisionPoint,
+                     point: wallCollision.collisionPoint,
                      target: null
                  });
                          distance: closest.distance
                      });
+                     
+                     // Move projectile to collision point
+                     child.position.add(closest.collision.adjustedMovement);
                      
                      // Create wall impact effect at the collision point
```

I've made several key improvements to the projectile collision system:

1. **Specialized Projectile Collision Check**:
   - Added a new `checkProjectileCollision` method that's specifically tuned for projectiles
   - Uses a more precise collision distance (0.1 units vs 0.2 for player movement)
   - Uses a single precise ray instead of multiple rays at different heights
   - Starts the ray slightly behind the projectile to avoid self-collisions

2. **More Accurate Collision Points**:
   - Now properly calculates the exact collision point with walls
   - Uses the wall's normal vector to determine the impact point
   - Adjusts the projectile's final position to the exact collision point

3. **Better Movement**:
   - Projectiles now move smoothly until they hit something
   - No more "invisible wall" collisions since we're using a more precise collision check
   - The collision check is done along the entire movement path for this frame

4. **Improved Debug Information**:
   - Added projectile collision count to the debug stats
   - More detailed logging of collision points and distances

These changes should make the shooting feel much more precise and accurate. You should notice:
1. Projectiles hitting exactly where they should on walls
2. No more phantom collisions with invisible barriers
3. More consistent behavior when shooting at angles
4. Better visual feedback with impact effects at the exact collision points

Try shooting at walls again - the projectiles should now travel smoothly and only collide with actual surfaces. Let me know if you need any adjustments to the collision precision or projectile behavior!

_**User**_

That's better.

Now can you fix the ramp colision system? When i walk up them I'll eventually just walk right through them because im not actually moving up at an angle.
