## Projectile Collision Fix for NPCs and Players (3/20/2025, 6:30:42 PM)

_**User**_

When I am shooting an NPC that is up against the wall, the projectile will often collide with the wall before the NPC, even though the NPC is in front of the wall.

Fix this, but make sure the fix applies to NPCs and players.

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix the projectile collision issue. This is likely a problem with the collision detection order or the way raycasting is being handled. Let me first check the relevant code.

Based on the code search, I can see that the issue is in the collision detection order and how we're handling projectile collisions. Currently, we're checking wall collisions and NPC collisions separately, but we need to handle them together and prioritize the closest collision point. Let me implement the fix.

              if (wallCollision.hasCollision) {

I've made several important changes to fix the projectile collision issue:

1. **Precise Collision Detection**: Instead of using simple sphere collisions, we now use raycasting to detect collisions with both walls and characters (NPCs/players). This provides much more accurate hit detection.

2. **Distance-Based Priority**: All collisions (wall and character) are now collected and sorted by distance. The closest collision is always handled first, which ensures that if an NPC is in front of a wall, their collision will be detected first.

3. **Improved Hitboxes**: Characters now have more precise box-shaped hitboxes that better match their model shape, making it easier to hit them when they're close to walls.

4. **Unified Collision System**: The collision system now handles both NPC and player hits in the same way, ensuring consistent behavior.

5. **Precise Hit Points**: When a collision is detected, the projectile is moved to the exact point of impact rather than the target's center, which provides better visual feedback.

These changes should resolve the issue where projectiles were hitting walls instead of NPCs that were in front of them. The system now:
1. Detects all possible collisions along the projectile's path
2. Sorts them by distance from the projectile
3. Handles the closest collision first

This means that if an NPC is standing in front of a wall, their collision will be detected and handled before the wall collision since they're closer to the projectile.

Would you like to test it out and let me know if you notice any improvements in the hit detection?

I see the issue. The error occurs because we're trying to use `NPC_HITBOX_HEIGHT` and other hitbox constants in the collision detection code, but these constants haven't been defined. Let me fix this by adding the necessary constants to the combat.js file.

---

_****_

```diff
  const PROJECTILE_SIZE = 0.12; // Slightly reduced for more precise hits
  const FIRE_RATE = 400; // Increased from 250ms to 400ms between shots (2.5 shots per second)
+ 
+ // Hitbox dimensions for NPCs and players
+ const NPC_HITBOX_WIDTH = 1.0;  // Width of the rat's trench coat
+ const NPC_HITBOX_HEIGHT = 2.0; // Full height of the rat
+ const NPC_HITBOX_DEPTH = 1.0;  // Depth of the rat's model
  
  // Store the socket reference for shooting events
```

---

_****_

I've added the necessary hitbox constants to the top of the combat.js file:
- `NPC_HITBOX_WIDTH`: Set to 1.0 units to match the width of the rat's trench coat
- `NPC_HITBOX_HEIGHT`: Set to 2.0 units to match the full height of the rat
- `NPC_HITBOX_DEPTH`: Set to 1.0 units to match the depth of the rat's model

These constants will now be available throughout the file, fixing the `ReferenceError` that was occurring in the collision detection code. The error was happening because we were trying to use these constants to create hitboxes for collision detection, but they weren't defined.

The hitbox dimensions are chosen to closely match the actual model size of the rat characters, with a slight padding to make hits feel more forgiving. You can now try shooting again, and the collision detection should work properly without any errors.

Let me know if you'd like to adjust any of these hitbox dimensions to make the hit detection feel more or less forgiving!

It says I am damaging and killing NPCs, but theyir health bar doesn't go down and they don't run away like they used to.

I see the issue. While we're detecting hits and updating the NPC's health in the combat system, we need to make sure we're properly updating the health bar and triggering the retreat behavior. Let me check the NPC-related code.

I see the issue. The problem is that we're not properly updating the health bar and AI state when damaging NPCs. Let me fix this by updating the combat.js file:

---

```diff

_****_

I've made several important fixes to the NPC damage handling:

1. **Health Bar Updates**: Now properly updating the health bar's scale, position, and color when an NPC takes damage. The health bar will now visually reflect the NPC's current health status.

2. **Retreat Behavior**: When an NPC is hit but not killed, they will now:
   - Enter the 'retreat' state for 1 second
   - Flash red to indicate they've been hit
   - The health bar will update to show their new health level

3. **Death Handling**: When an NPC is killed:
   - They'll drop to the ground (rotate sideways)
   - Their health bar will be hidden
   - They'll be marked as dead to prevent further interactions
   - They'll be removed from the scene after a 3-second delay

4. **Visual Feedback**: Added better visual feedback when NPCs are hit:
   - The NPC model will flash red
   - The health bar will change color based on health percentage (green > yellow > red)
   - Impact effects will be created at the hit location

5. **Debug Logging**: Added more detailed debug logging to help track the state of NPCs when they're hit.

Try shooting the NPCs again - you should now see:
1. Their health bars properly decrease
2. They flash red when hit
3. They try to retreat when damaged
4. They fall over and disappear when killed

Let me know if you notice any other issues with the NPC behavior!

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. The error occurs because we're trying to access the material's color property before verifying that the material exists. Let me fix this by adding proper checks for the material in the NPC hit handling code.

I've updated the NPC hit effect code to be more robust by:

1. **Safely Storing Original Material Properties**:
   - Now checking if color and emissive properties exist before cloning them
   - Storing the original emissive intensity separately

2. **Safe Material Modification**:
   - Creating a new material clone to avoid affecting other meshes
   - Only attempting to set the emissive color if the material has that property
   - Properly handling the case where some material properties might not exist

3. **Safe Material Reset**:
   - Checking if each property exists before trying to restore it
   - Using `copy()` to restore individual properties instead of replacing the entire material

This should fix the `TypeError` you were seeing because we now properly check for the existence of the material properties before trying to access them.

Try shooting the NPCs again - they should now:
1. Flash red when hit (if their material supports it)
2. Not cause any errors
3. Properly return to their original appearance after the flash effect

Let me know if you see any other issues with the hit effects!

_**User**_

That works perfectly now. But I want each shot to do 25 damage (or 25% of their health)

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the damage amount for projectiles. Looking at the code, I see that `PROJECTILE_DAMAGE` is currently set to 10. Let me update this to 25.

---

_****_

```diff
  
  const PROJECTILE_SPEED = 2.0; // Increased from 1.0 for much faster projectiles
- const PROJECTILE_DAMAGE = 10;
+ const PROJECTILE_DAMAGE = 25; // Each shot does 25 damage (25% of max health)
  const PROJECTILE_LIFETIME = 3000;
  const PROJECTILE_SIZE = 0.12; // Slightly reduced for more precise hits
```

---

_****_

I've updated the `PROJECTILE_DAMAGE` constant from 10 to 25. This means:
- Each shot will now do 25 damage
- Since NPCs have 100 health by default, this equates to 25% of their health per shot
- It will now take 4 shots to defeat an NPC (instead of 10)

The change is simple but effective. You should now see:
1. Health bars decreasing by 25% with each hit
2. NPCs being defeated after 4 successful hits
3. The same damage being applied to players when hit by NPC projectiles

Try it out and let me know if you'd like to make any adjustments to the damage amount!
