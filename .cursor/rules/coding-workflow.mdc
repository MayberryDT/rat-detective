# Coding workflow preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch the code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changesto the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed to do so
- Always think about whether other methods and areas of code might be affected by the code changes
